#TYPE OF ERRORS

# 1. SyntaxError
# Print 'Hello World'
#The above line of code, 'Hello World' would return a SyntaxError because of 
#the missing parenthesis print('Hello World)

#2. #NameError
# print (age)
#In the above line of code, age was not defined it would thereofre return a NameError when we try to print it.

#3. #IndexError
#numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#numbers[5]
#This code above would return with an error statement like this 'IndexError: list index out of range'.
#This error is due to attempt made in the second line to call a 5th index (numbers [5]) from the list 
# which only has for indexes.

#4. ModuleNotFoundError
#import maths
# The code above returned a ModuleNotFoundError when ran. This is because the there is no module named maths.
# The module name should be math instead.

#5. #AttributeError
An attribute error in Python programming language is an exception we get when you call an attribute from an 
object that does not exist or is not supported.
#from math import PI
# # The code above will return an ImportError because there is no a attribute called PI in math module
#  therefore cannot be imported. The correct statement should be 'from math import pi'

#6. #KeyError
# users = {'name':'Asab', 'age':250, 'country':'Finland'}
# users['county']

#The second line of the above code attempted to call a key named county which clearly not a key in the 
# dictionary therefore would return a KeyError. The correct statement should be users['country']

#7. #TypeError
# 4 + '3'
# This will return a TypeError because of an attempt to add to diffent data types (int and string). The correct
#syntax should be 4 + 3

#8. ImportError
#import math
#math.power
# This would return an AttributeError because there is no attribute called power in the math module. 
# The correct syntax should be 'math.pow'.

#9. ValueError
#int('12a'): This attempt to convert '12a' to integer will return ValueError because of the letter 'a' 
#attached to it.


#10. ZeroDivisionError
#1/0: This will return a ZeroDivisionError because nothing can be divided by zero

#11. IndentationError
#a = 2
#if a == 1:
#print (a)

# This code will return an IndentationError because the print statement was not supposed to be out of 
# the indented block of the if statement. Any statement that immediately  follows if, for or while loop, 
# function or classes etc stament should be indented.
